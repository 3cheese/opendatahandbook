## The problem
Public sector organisations often only consider what data can be open for all. However, there may be some types of data that may also be useful to publish, but can only be shared under certain restrictions. Conducting an initial overview of what data can be opened and establishing a corresponding scheme that indicates the category of openness of data makes it easier for public sector organisations to determine with whom data can be shared. For example, a colour scheme of green, yellow and red to indicate varying level of restrictions can be employed.

## The solution
*_An Open Data ombudsman and rethinking oversight authorities_, [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/03/28/an-open-data-ombudsman-and-rethinking-oversight-authorities/)
This piece explains the importance of creating an Open Data ombudsman tasked with implementation and management of open data programs and policies within government, acting exclusively within the public interest. Examples of these authorities from U.S. cities are cited.
*_Encourage collaborations across sectors_, [ODImpact Key Findings](http://odimpact.org/key-findings.html)
Key Findings from the Open Data Impact case studies (ODImpact) conducted by the GovLab recommends collaboration and data sharing between agencies.
*_Improving government access to government data_, [Value Story](http://opendatahandbook.org/value-stories/en/improving-gov-access/)
In British Columbia, one third of the government data portal's visits came from within the government, demonstrating the importance of cross-agency data sharing.
