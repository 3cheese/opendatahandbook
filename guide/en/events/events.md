##In case you need some ideas to gather your community around a specific events, in Open Knowledge we have developed a bunch of different events around open data. Some of these are in person events organized by the community, some are events that staff or communities attend and still others are online events.

###Introduction

Open Knowledge Events are important for the community. Some of the opportunities include: focus attention, gather audience around specific topics and represent both the public face of the organization and its multiple projects. It is a way to help data enthusiasts meet face to face to work and learn together.

###What can be called an Open Knowledge event?

Any event that is about Open Knowledge in any of its forms and shapes, is true to Open Knowledge values and is run by a member of Open Knowledge network (someone involved in a Local Group, Working Group, Open Knowledge project or Open Knowledge staff members) can be called and promoted as an Open Knowledge event.

###Why organise an Open Knowledge event?

Open Knowledge events focus on results. These results can be varied, from strengthening a local community to igniting a common passion about open data through talks and meetings, to writing a document together or to set up a workshop. In any case, before planning anything, you should ask yourself what you want your event’s outcome to be, and communicate it clearly. Your event will have a greater impact when you have a firm idea of what results you hope to inspire!

###What could be done during an Open Knowledge event?

The content of the event is up to its organiser – open knowledge is such a wide world, not even the sky is the limit. If you’re looking for an idea, here are some great things you might like to do:

* Explore a topic: talks, panels, Q&As, discussions
* Showcase projects and ideas: lighting talks, speed geeking
* Learn together and from each other: workshops, barcamp
* Working on a project together: text sprints, code sprints, datathons

###Events hosted by Open Knowledge

The events run by Open Knowledge are of three different kinds:

* Events directly organized by Open Knowledge Central (e.g. Open Knowledge Festival)
* Events organized by Open Knowledge network (Local Groups, Working Groups, Project Teams) following the community guidelines to ensure that values and integrity of the organization will be fully represented (e.g. workshops, sprints, hackathons)
* Events organized by third parties, considering each individual case and its requirements (e.g. paid training workshops, panels)


###Events hosted by Open Knowledge International

Open Knowledge International runs international events and small curated events by topic/region.

* Local Meetups - informal in-person get-togethers,  [from Cambridge to Cape Town to Copenhagen](http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/).
* Workshops - focussed on a particular topic. For example [Open Data and Cultural Heritage](http://openglam.org/2011/12/07/open-data-and-cultural-heritage-workshop/) or the   [Data Catalogues Interoperability Workshop](http://lod2.okfn.org/2011/05/04/notes-from-data-catalogues-interoperability-workshop-edinburgh-3-4th-may-2011/)
* Code Sprints - like the [Eurostat hackday](http://eurostat.okfn.org/)
* Text Sprints - like the one we did during the [Data Journalism Handbook Book Sprint](http://blog.okfn.org/2011/11/14/hacks-and-hackers-gather-to-write-the-first-data-journalism-handbook/) and the [Open Data Manual Book Sprint](http://blog.okfn.org/2010/09/30/open-data-manual-book-sprint/).
* [Open Knowledge Festival](okfestival.org) is our major international event for the whole community, with an informal, relaxed and celebratory feel.

###Events run by Open Knowledge network
*(These events are hosted by individuals, Local Groups, Working Groups, and Project Teams)*

Open Knowledge brings together a diverse community, creating a network of individuals and organisations, founded on key principles. The network, constituted by Local Groups, Working Groups and Project Teams, has the power to spread awareness and knowledge through offline and online events. These can be of various kinds and formats, but should always aim to reach a unique outcome, being this the consolidation of a grassroots local groups’ engagement, an online sprint or a panel gathering cutting-edge experts on a certain field. This handbook provides a set of guidelines to be observed for every event organized by Open Knowledge network. Then it will go into more detail, highlighting each format’s specific best practices.

As an OK'er, besides organising events, you will very likely attend lots of events organised by other organisations. We will explain further on what to do when you're representing OK at an event.

We are often approached about co-organising events or asked to host events for other organisations. For more information on this, please see [http://wiki.okfn.org/Events/Co-organising_Hosting Co-organising and Hosting Guide]
